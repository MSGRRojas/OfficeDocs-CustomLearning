# Why put effort into driving adoption?  

It is in the best interest of your company and your employees to get the most from your Office 365 investment.  Your employees can streamline their productivity and your data can be safe and secure inside of our services.  But the days of, "Build it and they will come." are long gone.  It is important to show employees in engaging ways how they can get the most out of these services.

Adoption programs can increase the digital literacy of your employees, simplify their productivity experience and lead to better business outcomes. Empowering your employees will ultimately empower your organization to achieve its goals.
